# NVIM Setup for Nekronos

> [!Disclaimer]
> This is my personal NVIM configuration files with plugins. This is not intended for general use: keybindings are unusual, the plugin selection is not optimal, it hasn't been thoroughly tested, etc. I consider this NVIM instance as simple and flexible, withouth providing a lot of functionality.

> Anyhow, if you find this helpful or you have any recommendations, please feel free to reach out to me.
